-** deleted fs and song_11, unused in code
-** used const for songs that i presume i dont want to change or later in the code
-** deleted labels from code, redundat to the code
-** changed from var to let, to evade the scope monster that var creates!?!
-** created a new json (dificulties) to evade missed written problems in the future to train
-** refactored 'for loop' from train funtion into a forEach for better 
    understanding and for fluency in code, snce we use forEach loops through the code
-** double negation is = to true, redundant, also, code, evercomplicated
-** refactored iterration in the train function,
    pushed json instead of array, to be clearer and make usage simpler
-** to be more obvious I substitutted every i and j in the code with
    chords and labels
-** declaration of numberOfSongs should be in loops
-** unnecesary declaration of numberOfSongs in setLabelProbabilities function,
    we can just divide to the length of the list of songs

-** deleted fs and song_11, unused in code
-** used const for songs that i presume i dont want to change or later in the code
-** deleted labels from code, redundat to the code
-** changed from var to let, to evade the scope monster that var creates!?!
-** created a new json (dificulties) to evade missed written problems in the future to train
-** refactored 'for loop' from train funtion into a forEach for better 
    understanding and for fluency in code, snce we use forEach loops through the code
-** double negation is = to true, redundant, also, code, evercomplicated
-** refactored iterration in the train function,
    pushed json instead of array, to be clearer and make usage simpler
-** to be more obvious I substitutted every i and j in the code with
    chords and labels
-** declaration of numberOfSongs should be in loops
-** unnecesary declaration of numberOfSongs in setLabelProbabilities function,
    we can just divide to the length of the list of songs
-** in ES6 there is a method for loops, "for 'key' in" that provides us
    the most straightforward way to loop over Object keys and values
-** the chord key of the object chordCountsInLabels[song.label] might
    not exist, changed > 0 to !== undefined + indenting
-** declaration of probabilityOfChordsInLabels not needed
-** for the function setProbabilityOfChordsInLabels i used the same ES6
    trick with 'for in' for the loops
-** we dont need multiplication by 1.0, its literally the same thing
-** indented code using /= and since i did not declared probabilityOfChordsInLabels,
    i will just get the songs length from the getNumberOfSongs function
